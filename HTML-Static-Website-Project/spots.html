        <h2>My Favorite NYC Spots</h2>
        <p>I enjoy exploring New York City, and here are some of my favorite spots:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Junction Deli (SkyBlue) - Best rolls/heroes/sandwiches ever (in my opinion)</li>
            <li>Silver Spoon Diner - Has great pizza. A little expensive though. </li>
            <li>Metropolitan Musuem of Art - Amazing art collections</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, NYC can get crowded and noisy sometimes, which can be challenging.</p>
